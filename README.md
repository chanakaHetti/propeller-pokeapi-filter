## Pokemon List app

#### Future improvements for performance and best practice suggestions

1. We can use state management and the Context API for scaling.
2. This PokeAPI doesn't support search queries, so I have to add a filter on the frontend. When we use a real API, we can improve this further.
3. Using React Query or Apollo Client for API caching.
4. Using Server Actions for performance and security.
   - Using Nextjs,
   - Server side rendering
   - Static Site Generator
   - Server side caching
5. Other performance optimizations.
   - Lazy Loading and Code Splitting (React.lazy and Suspense)
   - Image Optimization (Next Image component)
   - SSR and SSG
6. Unit Testing and E2E testing
   - React Testing Library
   - Jest
   - Cypress / Playwright
7. Maintaining well Documentation
   - Storybook
   - Manual Documentation
8. Accessibility enhancements.
   - Following the WCAG standard.
   - Improving color contrast.
   - Using the ARIA role.
9. SEO optimization (using Next.js).
10. UI/UX improvements.
11. Using monitoring and analytics tools.
    - Google Analytics
    - Sentry
12. Implementing CI/CD for seamless builds.
13. Cloud deployments for scalability.
14. Using the better version controlling
    - Better branches
    - Better commit messages
